# Tower Defence Game using Allegro 5

Brief Description:
1. I made a simple tower defence game with the help of Allegro 5 gaming engine.
2. Programming Language: C++ (with an aid of Allegro 5 game programming library)
3. Game Rules:

   - Player can place one or more towers to attack enemies.
   - Enemies can move along with the path (a simple Breadth-First Search algorithm inside), and those would be attacked by the defensive towers of the player.
   - A special spell which can eliminate all the enemies in sight is available.

3. Screenshots:
